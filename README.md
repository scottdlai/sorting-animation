# Sorting Animation

This project will animate the steps of sorting algorithms. Currently, it can
animate 4 different algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, and
quick sort).

You can try it out [here](https://scottdlai.github.io/sorting-animation/)

4. (Optional) You can click `Regenerate` to generate a new array to sort again.
